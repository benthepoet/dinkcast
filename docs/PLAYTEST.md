# Playtest pictures

Human-confirmed Flycast/hardware pictures. Host tests in `tests/test_playtest.c` lock the engine path so these cannot silently regress. A green `make host` is **not** a visual accept for anything still in **Open**.

Add a **Confirmed** row only when the requester has seen the picture and said it works. Add a host gate in the same PR.

## Open

- Feeding pigs / Milder (`s1-bul`) **spams** `edraw evict` + `mem refuse cpu_pixels` and hitch. This PR: `preload_seq` is frame 1, not all walk frames.
- Old man sprite in his house.
- Start-house textures after walking back.

Do not mark these confirmed until the requester says so. Name new pictures here when they report them.
